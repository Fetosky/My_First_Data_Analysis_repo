# Findings:
I found out that Paseo is the highest selling product in all the countries;
Montana did so bad in Mexico;
Discount boosted sales in all the countries;
sales is proportional to profit.

# Recommendations
Since Discount didn't reduce profit, discount should be continued in all the products.
More production of Paseo should encouraged'
more discount should be placed on Montana in Mexico.
