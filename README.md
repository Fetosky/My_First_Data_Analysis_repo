# Findings:
I found out that Paseo is the highest selling product in all the countries.
I found out that Montana did so bad in Mexico
I found out that Discount boosted sales in all the countries.
I found out that sales is proportional to profit.

# Recommendations
Since Discount didn't reduce profit, discount should be continued in all the products.
More production of Paseo should encouraged.
More discount should be placed on Montana in Mexico.
